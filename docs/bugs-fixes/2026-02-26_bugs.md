## BUG-5: ExerciseListScreen back arrow on Library tab
**Status:** OPEN
**Priority:** P2
**Reported:** 2026-02-26
**Screen:** Exercise List (`ExerciseListScreen.kt`)

### Problem
ExerciseListScreen shows a back arrow in its TopAppBar when accessed as the Library tab root. Tapping it calls `navController.popBackStack()` which returns false and does nothing. The arrow should be conditionally hidden when the screen is a top-level tab destination.

## BUG-6: Template exercise count shows 0 on Home screen
**Status:** OPEN
**Priority:** P2
**Reported:** 2026-02-26
**Screen:** Home (`HomePlaceholder.kt`)

### Problem
`TemplateInfo.exerciseCount` in the Recent Templates section is hardcoded to 0 because fetching exercise counts per template requires N+1 suspend calls. Needs a `getTemplatesWithExerciseCount()` query in `TemplateRepository`.

## BUG-7: Dead ProfilePlaceholder.kt in :app module
**Status:** OPEN
**Priority:** P3
**Reported:** 2026-02-26
**Screen:** N/A (dead code)

### Problem
`ProfilePlaceholder.kt` in the `:app` module is no longer referenced after the Settings screen was wired via `settingsScreen()` in `DeepRepsNavHost.kt`. Should be deleted.

## BUG-4: SkipSet does not auto-collapse exercise
**Status:** FIXED (2026-02-26)
**Priority:** P1
**Reported:** 2026-02-26
**Screen:** Active Workout (`WorkoutScreen.kt`)
**Plan:** `2026-02-26_plan_nav-settings-core-loop.md` (item 1.1)

### Problem
Skipping the last set of an exercise didn't auto-minimize it and advance to the next exercise. Completing the last set did auto-collapse correctly.

### Root Cause
`handleSkipSet()` in `WorkoutViewModel.kt` only updated the set status — it lacked the auto-advance logic that `handleCompleteSet()` had (check remaining sets -> collapse current -> expand next -> scroll -> rest timer).

### Fix
Extracted `maybeAutoAdvanceExercise(startRestTimer: Boolean)` helper, called from both handlers. No rest timer starts after skip-advance (unlike complete-advance). 4 new unit tests added.

## BUG-1: Exercise Order screen - drag-to-reorder is non-functional
**Status:** FIXED
**Priority:** P0
**Reported:** 2026-02-13
**Screen:** Exercise Order (`ExerciseOrderScreen.kt`)

### Problem
Exercises on the order screen cannot be dragged. The implementation uses `detectDragGesturesAfterLongPress` which requires a long-press to initiate drag. No visual affordance on the cards to suggest they're draggable.

### Fix
Replaced with touch-and-move drag. Added elevation, shift animation, and haptic feedback. Full details in earlier session.

## BUG-2: Plan Review screen - empty content, non-functional buttons
**Status:** FIXED
**Priority:** P0
**Reported:** 2026-02-13
**Screen:** Plan Review (`PlanReviewScreen.kt`)

### Problem
After hitting "Generate Plan", the Plan Review screen shows an empty plan. Both "Regenerate" and "Start Workout" buttons are non-functional.

### Root Cause
Multiple silent failures in the plan generation fallback chain. `userProfileRepository.get()` returning null, `executePlanGeneration()` setting PlanReady with empty list instead of Error phase.

### Fix
Fixed fallback chain, error state handling, and button states. Full details in earlier session.

## BUG-3: Exercise Detail screen - empty anatomy diagram
**Status:** FIXED
**Priority:** P1
**Reported:** 2026-02-13
**Screen:** Exercise Detail (`ExerciseDetailScreen.kt`)

### Problem
The "Anatomy Diagram" section shows only a colored placeholder box. No actual muscle visualization.

### Fix
Replaced placeholder with SVG-based anatomy diagram using muscle group highlighting. Full details in earlier session.
